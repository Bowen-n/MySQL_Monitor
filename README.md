# MySQL Monitor in Python
This is my project for *IS214:Database Theory* in SJTU. I develop a **log monitor** and **status monitor** for **MySQL** Database with python. For log monitor, I referred to repo [MySQLMonitor](https://github.com/TheKingOfDuck/MySQLMonitor). Based on that, I added a status monitor to this project.

I'll write a detailed guideline for this repo later :)
